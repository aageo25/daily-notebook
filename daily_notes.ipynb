    "#### Generating ground state structures\n",
    "First I tried [generating ground strucures](#Generating-ground-state-structures) with a perfect 4x4x4 supercell from the database entry `id=1`, however, it failed after 100 attempts. From the documentation, I understood that the concentration of the atoms object matters, although it says the opposite in the AuCu tutorial. To circumvent this problem, I chose the entry with `id=10`, and generated 10 ground state structures for further training (it is not a 4x4x4 supercell). By looking at the database, each entry has a certain concentration of Pt and Ni atoms, so I don't really know why using the entry with `id=1` did not work. Either way, I submittet the calculations to the queue. When these calculations finish, I will re-evaluate the CE model, and generate more ground state structures, if necessary."
